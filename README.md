1.
  An Activity where you'll be integrating with https://api.androidhive.info/pizza/?format=xml to get a list of foods,
their prices and short descriptions.
 You should satisfy all the following
	
- Integrate using 'fast android network' and XML parsing

- Display a list of the foods retrieved from the web service sorted alphabetically
	
- Show the Progress Dialog during the fetch of the data to be hidden once the data is fetched
	
- `Cache` the data, show it once the activity is opened and have a refresh button to re-fetch the data

- Display the last update time (In the toolbar or anywhere in the activity. In the toolbar would be a plus!)

2. 

 This activity should satisfy all the following
	
- Display a default image (keeping the `performance` in mind)
	
- Clicking on the image should open the camera and capture a picture then display it instead of the default picture
